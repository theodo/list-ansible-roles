List of ansible roles currently in use in our projects
======================================================
We provide here a list of ansible roles we use in our Symfony2, NodeJs and AngularJs projects. We don't use every role in every project. Just pick the roles you need to build your playbook. You are very welcome to add your favorite roles. We will also love to have PRs from you on our roles to make them better (or any comments).

Don't forget to specify a version of the role like : 	`ansible-galaxy install -i kosssi.composer,v1.0.3`
